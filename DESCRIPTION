Title: VST normalized RNA-Sequencing data with annotations for multiple species samples from Bgee
Description: Variance Stabilized Transformation of Read Counts derieved from Bgee RNA-Seq Expression Data. 
  Expression Data includes annotations and is across 6 species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicius,
  Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans) and across more than 132 tissues. The data
  is represented as a RData files and is available in ExperimentHub.
