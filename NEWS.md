#New Package Release
CoSIAdata includes Variance Stabilized Transformation of Read Counts from 
Bgee RNA-Seq Expression Data across six species (*Homo sapiens*, *Mus musculus*,
*Rattus norvegicius*,*Danio rerio*, *Drosophila melanogaster*, and 
*Caenorhabditis elegans*) and more than 132 tissues. Each species has its own 
independent data frame with its unique set of tissue and gene specific 
expression data.
 
CoSIAdata is meant to be integrated into the CoSIA Package, a visualization 
tool for cross species comparison of expression metrics. However, it can be 
used to conduct independent species, tissue, and gene-specific 
expression analysis.
